2- COGS as % of Revenue targets: Excellent = under 45%, Good = 45-50%, Average = 50-55%, Poor = over 55%. YoY Change in COGS rule: COGS growth should be 
less than revenue growth - if revenue grows 10%, COGS should grow less than 8%. For scoring, give 60 points for the percentage ratio and 40 points for 
the growth comparison, total = 100 points maximum. With Morocco's banking sector growing 13.5% Moroccan Banking Sector Hits Historic 13.5% Growth, 
Projects $2.2 Billion Profit by 2026, look for banks with COGS ratios between 47-52% and COGS growing slower than their revenue growth. Simple example: i
f Bank A has 48% COGS ratio (good = 70 points) and COGS grew 6% while revenue grew 12% (excellent control = 40 points), total score = 110 points. Compare 
this across all banks to find the most efficient one - higher scores mean better cost management and stronger investment choice.
