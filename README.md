# 🟡 GOLD MARKET CAUSAL INTELLIGENCE ENGINE  
### *Macro-Driven Gold Forecasting with FT-Transformer*

---

## 🎯 PROJECT PURPOSE

This project builds a **high-signal machine learning system** designed to uncover **historical, structural, and causal relationships** between **macroeconomic forces** and **gold price movements**.

It is **not** a price-only predictor.  
It is a **macro-causal engine** focused on **why gold moves**, not just *when*.

The system learns from decades of economic data and produces a reusable **correlation intelligence file** that can be applied to new data streams.

## 🧠 CORE IDEA (IN ONE PASS)

> Feed large-scale economic data →  
> Train an FT-Transformer →  
> Extract stable historical relationships →  
> Store them in a correlation file →  
> Re-apply them to new monthly data →  
> Output a **gold market movement prediction**

## 📥 MODEL INPUTS (MACRO DRIVERS)

All data is **time-aligned**, **lag-aware**, and **cleaned for causality**.

### 🔴 Inflation & Monetary Pressure
- CPI (headline & core)
- Inflation expectations
- TIPS breakevens
- Real interest rates

### 🔵 Market Price Context
- Gold spot & futures prices
- USD Index (DXY)
- Treasury yields
- Equity indices (risk regime)

### 🟠 Geopolitical & Risk Signals
- Volatility indices (VIX)
- Geopolitical risk indicators
- Event-driven stress metrics

### 🟢 Gold Demand & Flow Data
- Central bank gold purchases
- ETF inflows / outflows
- Physical demand (China, India)
- Futures positioning & open interest

## 🤖 MODEL ARCHITECTURE

### 🧩 FT-Transformer (Tabular Transformer)

Chosen because it:
- Handles **structured economic data**
- Learns **non-linear feature interactions**
- Preserves **feature-level interpretability**
- Scales across long historical windows

This makes it suitable for **macro regime learning**, not short-term noise fitting.

---

## 🏋️ TRAINING OBJECTIVE

The model is trained to:

✅ Identify **stable historical relationships**  
✅ Detect **lagged causal effects**  
✅ Separate **signal vs macro noise**  
✅ Encode knowledge into a reusable artifact  

The goal is **economic memory**, not overfitting.

## 📤 OUTPUT ARTIFACTS

### 📄 1. Historical Correlation Intelligence File

A persistent file containing:

- Feature-wise correlations
- Importance weights
- Lag sensitivities
- Regime-dependent behavior

This file represents the **learned macro structure** of gold.

---

### ⚙️ 2. Inference / Prediction Engine

When **new monthly data** is fed into:
- A Python bot
- An ML pipeline
- Any external application

The system will:

1️⃣ Validate feature compatibility  
2️⃣ Align new data with training schema  
3️⃣ Compare against historical correlations  
4️⃣ Apply learned macro logic  
5️⃣ Output a **predicted gold market movement**

---

## 🧪 INPUT CONSISTENCY RULE

⚠️ The inference data **must match** the original training features:
- Same variables
- Same structure
- Same normalization logic

This ensures **valid macro comparison**, not distorted output.

---

## 📈 FINAL OUTPUT

The result is:
- A **directional gold movement prediction**
- Backed by **historical macro relationships**
- Suitable for reuse in:
  - Trading systems
  - Risk overlays
  - Portfolio construction
  - Research & scenario analysis

---

## 🧭 PHILOSOPHY

This project is **not** a black-box signal generator.

It is a **macro-causal decision engine** designed to:
- Explain gold behavior
- Anticipate regime shifts
- Support high-conviction decisions

Gold is treated as a **macro asset**, not a chart pattern.
